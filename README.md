# Frontend Mentor - Counter Project

This is a solution to a self-initiated project inspired by a freeCodeCamp tutorial. While I didn't code along with the tutorial, I drew inspiration from it to create my own version of a counter application, which allowed me to practice and apply my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript for interactivity

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Here’s a snippet of the code I’m proud of:

```js
decreaseBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
    count--;
    p.innerText = count;
    updateColor();
});
```

I also explored using CSS custom properties and practiced designing responsive layouts using Flexbox.

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on improving my JavaScript skills, especially in manipulating the DOM and handling user interactions. Additionally, I want to explore more complex CSS layouts and design techniques.
